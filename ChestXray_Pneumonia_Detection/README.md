# Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detection 🩻🧠

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It is part of a broader effort in the **Medical Image Analysis** domain to automate disease diagnosis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

We use a labeled dataset of chest X-rays, preprocess it, visualize it, and then train a model to classify images as either **NORMAL** or **PNEUMONIA**.
