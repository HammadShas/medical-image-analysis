## 🩺 Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It is part of the broader **Medical Image Analysis** repository and aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing an automated and reliable diagnostic aid. The project explores data preprocessing, visualization, and model development using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enabling early detection and improving diagnostic efficiency.

### Key Goals:
- 📊 Load, visualize, and explore the dataset  
- 🧼 Preprocess X-ray images for model readiness  
- 🧠 Train and evaluate deep learning models for binary classification (Pneumonia vs. Normal)  
- 🧪 Plan for future improvements including model deployment and performance tuning
